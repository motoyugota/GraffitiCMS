 About the v2.0 Refactoring Branch
====================================

This branch was started as a copy of the 1.3 branch
around Feb 2010 timeframe. It was intended to be the future
version 2.0 release, and put in the "trunk" folder at first.

In March 2010 Dan Hounshell made extensive (and much needed) refactoring
changes to decouple many components and modernize the codebase. 
The SQL backend was not changed, so no db upgrade scripts were needed.

Unfortunately we split off the 2.0 branch too early in hindsight.
The 1.3 version still needed a good deal of work and bug fixing, and with
limited available time/resources by all involved, we failed to keep the 
2.0 branch up-to-date. 

This branch will need to be updated or re-merged with the final 1.3 version.
When that happens, it should in Trunk.
