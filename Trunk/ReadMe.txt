********************
 Graffiti 2.0 Alpha
********************

NOTES:

* Trunk is NOT STABLE! It will be undergoing heavy refactoring and modernization.

* For now, use the 1.3 Branch if you want to run Graffiti CMS in production.

* Currently Trunk only supports SQL Server.  Additional databases may be supported in the future.

* To run, update the web.config to use the appropriate database connection string. Sample connection strings for various database types are included in the web.config comments.

* Setup the database using the instructions in the \Trunk\data\read_me.txt file.
