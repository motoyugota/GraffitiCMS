	custom styles for Gulf Coasting that YOU define
	------------------------------------------------------
	
	This stylesheet will allow you to futureproof your
	changes against future releases and upgrades of this 
	theme. I know you work hard on your modified styles, 
	and I don't want you to feel like every upgrade is a 
	total drag!
	
	Instructions:
	
	Modifying existing styles to your liking is a breeze 
	with this handy stylesheet. The Gulf Coasting theme
	will link to style.css and then this one (custom.css).
	Because of this, you now have the ability to override 
	ANY style that's declared in the original Gulf Coasting
	style.css in this file.
	
	In practice, you simply need to copy the CSS for the
	element that you want to change (from style.css) and
	then paste it below this comment section.
