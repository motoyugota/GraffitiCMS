
Changes since the last public release v1.2

* jQuery: we should now fully support jQuery instead of prototype. 

* routing: routing is now used and writing files to disk has been made a control panel option. Routing requires IIS 7 or above and ASP.NET 3.5 SP1.

* control panel/web.config: The control panel has been cleaned up quite a bit and many configurations settings once made in the web.config now have a web UI.

* vistadb: due to licensing contraints, we are unable to ship vistadb directly with the source. We will be working with them to make this a provider available for download from their site.
