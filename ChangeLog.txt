
Last public release: 1.2.

December 11, 2009
-jQuery: we should now fully support jQuery instead of prototype. 
-routing: routing is now used and writing files to disk has been made a control panel option. 
-control panel/web.config: The control panel has been cleaned up quite a bit and many configurations settings once made in the web.config now have a web UI.
-vistadb: due to licensing contraints, we are unable to ship vistadb directly with the source. We will be working with them to make this a provider available for download from their site.
